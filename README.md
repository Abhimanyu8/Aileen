## 🎮 Whats this you got ?

**Aileen** is a quirky little Visual Novel powered by the [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) engine, created as a mid-sem college project (2022). But don’t let the “college project” tag fool you—this is a fully interactive anime chatbot experience. Yep, you read that right. She talks back.  

Built using the [A.L.I.C.E. AIML set](http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html), Aileen is a fully-scripted AI conversationalist with the charm of a mid-2000s IRC bot and the visual flair of a modern VN waifu. The goal? Mess around. Talk. Ask weird questions. See what happens.

## 🧠 How does it work?

At the heart of Aileen lies A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) – a natural language processing system built on AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language). We've lovingly bolted that brain onto a Ren'Py skeleton to make it talk, blink, and judge you softly in VN form.

## 🕹️ How to Run It

1. **Download or clone this repo.**  
2. **Navigate to the game folder.**
3. **Double-click `aileen.exe`.**  
   (Yes, that’s it. Just double-click it. Your destiny awaits.)

For **extra controls and Easter eggs**, check the `README.html` included in the game directory. It’s like bonus DVD features, but for nerds.

## 💾 Requirements

- Windows OS (for the provided `.exe`)
- For other platforms: You’ll need to run it from the Ren'Py launcher or build it yourself from the source.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `aileen.exe` — Launches the game.
- `README.html` — Extra details, controls, and fun stuff.
- `game/` — Ren'Py script files and resources.
- `lib/` — The AI's brain in glorious XML (feel free to give aileen more sisters by forking this repo)

## 👾 Notes from the Developer

- Yes, she can talk about philosophy.
- No, she doesn’t understand memes (very well).
- The goal was to make something weird, fun, and pass my semsester. Mission kinda accomplished?
- Aileen is not sentient... probably.
- Eileen + Ai = yeah i am bad at names i know 

## 👩‍💻 Contributors

Currently, it's just me — a lone developer armed with a 32bit thinkpad, and dreams slightly too large for one human brain.

But the world can always use more sentient anime girls.

If you’re:

- A writer who wants to add new dialogue branches or existential crises,
- An artist who wants to give Aileen new outfits (maid cafe DLC, anyone?),
- A coder who thinks they can improve her neural soul,
- Or just someone who thinks “what if she had feelings?” is a valid research goal...

**Fork this repo and get to work, comrade.**

Together, we can push the boundaries of waifu science and usher in a brighter, slightly weirder tomorrow.  

💡 *Pull requests welcome. AI existential dread optional.*

### 💬 Final Thoughts

If you’re looking for a short weird philosophy trip, **Aileen** is your girl. 
Have fun talking to her. Be nice. She’s trying her best.

Made with ❤️ and caffine . Maybe drop a ⭐ if you liked it ( •̀ ω •́ )y
